English language, while global and convenient, is not culturally neutral.

Most programming languages use English for their keywords, variable names, builtin functions and type methods, making it a bit hader for non-English speakers to learn them, especially, for the elderly population.

This is a little attempt to create a way for people of the world, regardless of their native language, to easily pick up programming, by creating a way to translate not only the interpreter's user messages/errors/warnings, but also the lanuguage itself -- keywords, variable names, builtin functions and type methods.

The idea is to write a universal pre-parser for all programming languages, which would parse a program written in foreign language before actually parsing it with the interpreter, translate its keywords and built-in functions int English for the actual interpreter.

In every programming language, we have a source code files with traditional extensions, e.g., python with .py, C with .c, JavaScript with .js, PHP with .php, etc. What we could do, is:

1. Indicate source code in other languages by extended file extensions, e.g.:
  .py.de - German
  .py.cn - Chinese
  .py.fr - French
   ...
   etc.

2. to create a wrapper for interpreters of these languages.

The wrapper interpreter would have to be able to tokenize code exactly as the original programming language does, and then recognize and substitute the core language tokens (e.g., keyword argumetns, built-in functions) by appropriate language of the original interpreter/compiler (most are English).


For example, it has been suggested to use the following words in case of Chinese version of Python.

写 ..(print)
删除 ..(del)
定义/函数 (def)
忽略 (pass)
中断 (break)
下一个 (continue)
传回 (return)
示警 (raise)
载入 ... 名 ... (import ... as ...)
从 ... 载入 ...
共用 (global)
执行 (exec)
断言 (assert)
如.. 不然.. 否则.. (if .. elif .. else ..)
只要 .. 否则 .. (while .. else ..)
取 .. 自 .. 然后 .. (for .. in .. else ..)
试.. 失败.. 否则.. 然后.. (try .. exc​​ept .. else .. finally .. )
概念/类别 (class)
来自/不来自 (in / not in)
是/不是 (is / is not)
或 or
且 and
不是 not
